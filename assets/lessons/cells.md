Topic: Basics of Cell Structure and Function
1. Introduction (5 Minutes)

    Objective: Provide an overview of what the student will learn in the session.
    Engagement Question: "Have you ever wondered what the smallest unit of life looks like and how it functions?"

2. Overview of Cells (10 Minutes)

    Definition: Explain what a cell is and its importance.
    Types of Cells: Differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells with simple examples (e.g., bacteria vs. human cells).
    Scale and Visualization: Show images/diagrams of cells under a microscope.

3. Cell Structure (15 Minutes)

    Cell Membrane: Describe its function as a protective barrier and its role in regulating what enters and leaves the cell.
    Cytoplasm: Explain it as the 'factory floor' where most cellular activities occur.
    Nucleus: Introduce it as the 'control center' of the cell, containing DNA.
    Mitochondria: Explain its role as the 'powerhouse' of the cell, generating energy.
    Ribosomes: Describe their function in protein synthesis.
    Other Organelles:
        Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Differentiate between rough ER and smooth ER.
        Golgi Apparatus: Explain its role in packaging and transporting proteins.
        Lysosomes: Describe their function in waste removal.

4. Interactive Activity (10 Minutes)

    Virtual Tour: Use an interactive 3D model of a cell to explore different organelles.
    Quiz Questions:
        "What is the function of the mitochondria?"
        "Where are proteins synthesized in the cell?"
    Q&A: Allow the student to ask questions and clarify any doubts.

5. Real-World Application (5 Minutes)

    Relate to Everyday Life: Discuss how understanding cells can help us learn about diseases, develop medicines, and comprehend how our bodies work.
    Current Research: Briefly mention exciting advancements in cell biology (e.g., stem cell research or cancer treatment).

6. Conclusion and Review (5 Minutes)

    Summary: Recap the key points covered in the session.
    Take-Home Message: Emphasize the importance of cells as the building blocks of life.
    Homework/Next Steps: Suggest a short reading or video to reinforce the concepts learned.

7. Feedback (5 Minutes)

    Student Reflection: Ask the student what they found most interesting or challenging.
    Tutor Feedback: Provide positive feedback and areas for improvement.
