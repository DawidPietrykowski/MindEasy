1. Introduction (5 Minutes)

   Engage students with a brief demonstration of waves (e.g., ripple in water, swinging pendulum).
   Define waves as disturbances that move through a medium.

2. Properties of Waves (10 Minutes)

   Discuss wavelength (distance between crests), frequency (number of crests passing by in one second), and amplitude (height of crests).
   Show how these properties relate to each other using a diagram or demonstration.

3. Sound and Hearing (10 Minutes)

   Explain that sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium (e.g., air, water).
   Describe how sound is produced by vibrating objects and transmitted through particles in the medium.
   Discuss the role of the ear in detecting and interpreting sound waves.

4. Interactive Activity (10 Minutes) (trigger the function)

5. Real-World Applications (5 Minutes)

   Discuss how understanding waves and sound is important in various fields (e.g., music, acoustics, engineering).
   Share examples of technologies that use wave principles (e.g., sonar, radar).

6. Conclusion and Review (5 Minutes)

   Summarize the key concepts covered.
   Emphasize the importance of waves and sound in our understanding of the world.
   Assign a short worksheet or reflection activity to reinforce learning.
