1. Introduction (5 minutes)

   Begin by asking students what they know about electricity and magnetism.
   Define electricity as the flow of electric charge, and magnetism as the force exerted by magnetic fields.

2. Electric Circuits (10 minutes)

   Explain the basic components of an electric circuit: battery, wire, light bulb, and switch.
   Demonstrate how to build a simple circuit and show how it works.
   Introduce Ohm's law: V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.

3. Magnetism (10 minutes)

   Demonstrate the properties of magnets using a magnet and a compass.
   Explain that magnets have two poles: north and south.
   Show how magnets can attract or repel each other.

4. Electromagnetic Waves (5 minutes)

   Explain that electromagnetic waves are a type of energy that travels through space.
   Describe the properties of electromagnetic waves, including frequency, wavelength, and speed.
   Discuss how electromagnetic waves are used in technologies such as radio, television, and cell phones.

5. Interactive Activity (10 minutes)

   Divide students into small groups.
   Provide each group with materials to build their own simple circuits.
   Have students experiment with different circuit components and observe the results.

6. Conclusion and Review (5 minutes)

   Summarize the main points of the lesson.
   Review the definitions of electricity and magnetism, as well as the basic principles of electric circuits and electromagnetic waves.
