1. Introduction (5 Minutes)

   Engage students with a brief demonstration or real-world example that illustrates the concept of motion.
   Introduce the topic of Newton's Laws of Motion.

2. Newton's First Law (10 Minutes)

   Definition: State Newton's First Law, also known as the Law of Inertia.
   Concept: Explain that an object in motion stays in motion and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an external force.
   Examples: Discuss examples of objects in motion and objects at rest.

3. Newton's Second Law (10 Minutes)

   Definition: State Newton's Second Law, which defines the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.
   Formula: F = ma
   Concept: Explain that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to its mass.
   Examples: Provide real-world examples of forces causing objects to accelerate.

4. Newton's Third Law (5 Minutes)

   Definition: State Newton's Third Law, the Law of Action and Reaction.
   Concept: Explain that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
   Examples: Discuss examples of action-reaction pairs in everyday life.

5. Conclusion and Review (5 Minutes)

   Summarize the key concepts of Newton's Laws of Motion.
   Highlight their significance in understanding the behavior of objects in motion.
   Suggest further resources for students to explore.
