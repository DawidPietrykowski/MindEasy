1. Introduction (5 Minutes)

   Definition of photosynthesis and respiration.
   Importance of these processes for life on Earth.

2. Photosynthesis (15 Minutes)

   Sunlight as the energy source for photosynthesis.
   Key steps:
   Light absorption by chlorophyll.
   Conversion of light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH).
   Use of ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.
   Importance of oxygen as a byproduct.

3. Respiration (15 Minutes)

   ATP as the energy currency of cells.
   Cellular respiration as the process of breaking down glucose to release energy.
   Key steps:
   Glycolysis: Breakdown of glucose in the cytoplasm.
   Krebs cycle: Further breakdown of glucose in the mitochondria.
   Electron transport chain: Production of ATP using the electron gradient.
   Importance of carbon dioxide and water as byproducts.

4. Interactive Activity (10 Minutes) (trigger the function)

5. Comparison and Contrast (10 Minutes)

   Similarities and differences between photosynthesis and respiration:
   Both involve chemical reactions.
   Both produce ATP.
   Both involve the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide).
   Differences:
   Photosynthesis uses sunlight, while respiration uses glucose.
   Photosynthesis produces glucose, while respiration breaks it down.

6. Real-World Application (5 Minutes)

   Importance of photosynthesis for oxygen production and food chains.
   Significance of respiration for energy production and maintaining homeostasis.

7. Conclusion and Review (5 Minutes)

   Recap of the key concepts of photosynthesis and respiration.
   Take-home message: Importance of these processes for life on Earth.
   Homework/Next Steps: Encourage students to research specific aspects of photosynthesis or respiration in more depth.

8. Feedback (5 Minutes)

   Student reflection on what they found most interesting or challenging.
   Tutor feedback and suggestions for improvement.
