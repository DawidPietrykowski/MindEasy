1. Introduction (5 Minutes)

   Objective: Explain the concept of thermodynamics and its importance in understanding energy transfer and transformations.

2. First Law of Thermodynamics (10 Minutes)

   Definition: Explain the law of conservation of energy.
   Energy Forms: Discuss different forms of energy (e.g., heat, work, kinetic energy).
   First Law Equation: Introduce the mathematical equation Î”U = Q - W.
   Applications: Provide examples of energy transfer and transformations in everyday life.

3. Second Law of Thermodynamics (15 Minutes)

   Entropy: Define entropy and explain the concept of disorder and randomness.
   Spontaneous Processes: Discuss the direction of spontaneous processes (e.g., heat flows from hot to cold, disorder increases over time).
   Heat Engines: Explain how heat engines work by converting heat into work.
   Carnot Cycle: Introduce the Carnot cycle as a theoretical model for a heat engine with maximum efficiency.
